### How to Run This Platform❓
The platform is currently still under construction...

#### Environment Setup🔨:
***
This GitHub repository only contains the frontend project, built using Vue, npm (Node Package Manager) as the package manager, and utilizes the [Element-Plus](https://element-plus.org/) frontend framework.

Before running the project, please run
`npm install`
to install the necessary libraries and dependencies listed in package.json.

Use
`
npm run dev
`
to start the project for an early preview experience.

#### Important❗:
***
The intelligent assistant Xiaohui needs to communicate with the server for data interaction to function properly.
The backend server project is not yet uploaded to GitHub.

Please note that the translation might need further adjustments based on the actual content and context.
